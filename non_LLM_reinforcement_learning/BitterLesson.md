Date read: 26th August 2025

## Key Points
* Scaling compute almost always outperforms human design biases eventually.
* This is **the bitter lesson**, no matter how much we think we know better, scaling will normally outperform our human 
biases. 
* The trap is that embedding human knowledge is psychologically satisfying and often yields short term improvements.
* This has been shown in chess, go, shogi etc.
