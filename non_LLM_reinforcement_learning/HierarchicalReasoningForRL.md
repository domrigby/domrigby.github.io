## Key Points
* Creates Hierarchical Reasoning Model for RL: HRM-Agent
* Reasoning in RL is planning
* Why?
	* LLMs and model-based RL often suffer not dynamically changing the amount of compute used
	* HRM learns to choose how much compute it should use
	* Multi-level reasoning allows for multi-level planning
* They reuse the latent representations from last step to reuse previous processing and promote consistency
* Tests it on path planning
