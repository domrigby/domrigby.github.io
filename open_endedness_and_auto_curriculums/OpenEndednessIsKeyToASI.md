# Key Points
* **Defines Open-Endedness**: a system which can generate **novel** and **learnable** artefacts.
  * This is **dependent on the observer**. E.g. what is learnable to a human might not be learnable to a mouse
  * This depends on cognitive abilities like memory, which influences how learnable a new artefact is.
  * **Time-horizon dependent**: tasks will often plateau in learnability due to limitations of the environment.
  * 
If they can't remember previous artefacts, they may struggle to understand this new one.
* Foundation models provide a promising method for exploring the huge search space in a meaningful manner. They have
**learned intuition about what human find interesting** and can therefore probe interesting areas.
* Open-endedness is an **inherently experimental process** and requires interaction with the learning space.
* Open-endedness requires guidance from an observer as to what we wish to learn. E.g. humans want to solve
interesting human problems.
