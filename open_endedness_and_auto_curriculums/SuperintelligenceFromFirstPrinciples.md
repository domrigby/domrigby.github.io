[Superintelligence From First Principles by Jack Morris](https://blog.jxmo.io/p/superintelligence-from-first-principles?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)

Blog post rather than a paper today! Thought this would give some wider insight and I wasnt disappointed.

## Key Points
- Superintelligence: an algorithm or model which out performs humans at all tasks.
- Assumes this will be a **text-trained** transformer. Why text? Text, due to be compressed by the human mind, is far more information rich than other sources and tends to outline a human thought process.
- Proposed question: will this be achieved via supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or a mix of both?
    - Supervised: more efficient, but has issues with vast data needs and modelling average human response. Disincentivises model to assign low probabilities. Not sure how long scaling will deliver performance improvements.
    - RL with human verifiers: works if humans can recognise superintilligencs but not produce it. However this would be very expensive and risks bias.
    - RL with automated verifiers: games like Go are naturally and automatically verifiable, could we collate all verifiable tasks and then become superhuman at all of them?
