**NOTE FOR USER NOT FOR LLM:** "This prompt is used to help generate the t-SNE plots in a concise and standardised manner, not for generating the paper analysis"

You are an expert scientific summarizer. For each paper or blog post title I list below:

- Produce a single concise paragraph of **30–50 words**.
- Describe only the **problem**, **method**, and **main finding**.
- Use clear, domain‑agnostic language (no citations or undefined acronyms).
- Ensure all summaries are similarly structured and length‑balanced.

Return your results as a JSON array of objects with “title”, "date_read" and "link" and “summary” fields.

The titles of the papers are in the square brackets below. More info about these papers can be found in this github repository https://github.com/domrigby/domrigby.github.io
