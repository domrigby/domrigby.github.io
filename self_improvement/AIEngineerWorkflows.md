## Key Points
* Interviewed the company Every's six engineer to see how these use AI

## Common Themes
* Many use multiple coding engines to see which one comes up with best result
* Plan day using LLMs, get the LLMs to break the tasks down to atomic steps and then use these steps to get the agent to implement the code.
* One **maintains a document of everything he learns from the agent** to maintain a long term memory he can use in future prompts.
* One spends afternoomn using new tools and morning using already known ones to ensure the job gets done.
* Special prompt to plan into task into actions for AI agents
* **Codex by OpenAI is the most popular coding tool** and then Claude to refine details
* Some use LLMs to generate tests and edge cases
* **Good idea to check line by line** and break down code into smaller taks
* Difficulty: **LLMs don't produce code like rest of the code base**
