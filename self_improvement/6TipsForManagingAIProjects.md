## Key Points
1. Understand **why** you are using AI:
	* What does it bring that other technologies won't?
	* Make sure the team understand this
2. Define architecture and understand where the AI fits in. It does not need to be end-to-end AI
3. Understand the RL product life cycle:
	* Understand problem + business value -> How do we model this? -> Which algorithms -> Train -> Test -> Deploy
4. Short iterations with iterative improvements: deliver early and then improve. Communicate early and often.
5. Start small, prove the concept and then scale up. Make sure you understand the constraints.
6. Always try and understand the inherent biases
