## Key Points
* Previous revolution example: Industrial Revolution
	* World GDP per capita stayed roughly constant from 0 to 1750
	* It has 14x since then. Life expectancy has also shot up
	* **All these improvements were built on top of scientific innovations**. E.g. steam engine, vaccines

* Modern issue: research and development is getting more expensive and less productive
	* Maintaining Moore's Law is becoming more expensive
	* **Eroom's Law**: Number of novel drugs produced per billion dollars spent has halved every 9 years from 1951 to 2011.

* How can AI help tackle this?
	1. **Increase velocity, volume and variety of design generation**	
		* Generate more designs quickly with more variety
		* Real world example: store designs, protein design
	2. **Accelerate evolution of candidates**
		* Approximate things like FEA and physical tests using surrogates
		* real world examples: wether prediction
	3. **Accelerate research operations**
		* Ideas, code, evaluating customer needs can all be accelerated by LLMs
		* Examples:
			* Summarising and exploring existing research
			* Knowledge management
			* Automating documentation
			* Idea creation

* **Will have most impact in software as it is text based**
