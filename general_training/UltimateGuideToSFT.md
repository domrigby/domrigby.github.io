**arXiv Link:** (Blog post / guide, not a formal paper)  
## Key Points:
- Comprehensive overview of fine‐tuning techniques for large language models across various domains. 
- Stresses the critical importance of data management: cleaning, deduplication, diversity, representativeness, and stratification.  
- Surveys many popular fine‐tuning methods—LoRA, adapter‐based tuning, full‐parameter fine‐tuning, prompt tuning, etc. and compares their trade‐offs.  
- Emphasizes that fine‐tuning is not just an optimization problem but a data curation and pipeline engineering challenge.  

## Key Methods:
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** only train low‐rank update matrices on top of frozen pre‐trained weights to save compute/memory.  
- **Adapter Tuning:** insert small “adapter” modules between model layers that are the only parameters updated.  
- **Prompt Tuning & Prefix Tuning:** keep the backbone frozen; prepend trainable tokens/embeddings to prompts to steer behavior.  
- **Data‐centric best practices:**  
  - Deduplication: remove near duplicates to reduce overfitting.  
  - Augmentation: generate paraphrases/back‐translations to boost tail examples.  
  - Stratified sampling: ensure balanced representation of classes/tasks.  
  - Continual monitoring: track out‐of‐distribution (OOD) drift and retrain as needed.
