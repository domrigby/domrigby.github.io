# JaxMARL

Date: 5th June 2025

## Key Points
- Simulating on the CPU and inferring and training on the GPU is slow. 
It is far more time efficient to do both on GPU.
- JaxMARL implement several famous MARL environments and algorithms on the GPU.
- This delivered 3 order of magnitude speed up in training.
